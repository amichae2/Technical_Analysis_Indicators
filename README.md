# Technical_Analysis_Indicators
These are indicators I have used in my own Investment Algorithm

Anyone can use this code for any purpose (hopefully friendly ones though)

Currently, the indicators in this code are:

-Williams VIX Fix with Bollinger Bands and High and Low Range as seen on Tradingview by Chris Moody
-The Supertrend (From https://github.com/hackingthemarkets/supertrend-crypto-bot (hackingthemarkets) crypto trading bot)
-Beta (calculated using the percent change (instead of alpha) like Yahoo Finance and Zacks use)
-Rolling Linear Regression like Trading View
-Support and Resistance levels are calculated by taking the slope of the ema of the prices of a given stock. The closer it is to 0 the more the stock is trading sideways.

I've found these to be quite reliable in my own experience and hope to expand on this code in the future.

For more information on the Williams VIX Fix check out the pdf in this repo and link in its description: https://github.com/amichae2/Williams-Vix-Fix-with-Bollinger-Bands-and-Range
